This is a AGENTS.md file.

For every code, I will write a brief description of its purpose and functionality.

e.g. index.md is a brief introduction to index.html.

After update the file, don't commit until I have reviewed the changes.

Don't update descriptions.

Don't write duplicate code if not necessary.
